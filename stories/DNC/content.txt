## Does Not Compute

The world we live in is full of bafflement, frustration and incomprehension. Although technology can’t be blamed for everything it is central to much of what we find difficult on a daily basis, whether it be figuring out how to recover a lost password, set the timer on the oven or just get inside the shrink wrap of a product that didn’t need packaging in the first place.

So I had the idea of starting a blog where I could complain and explain at the same time, and this is where it starts. However, in spite of all my best intentions I soon drifted into a far richer area, that of politics - and in particular Brexit. I make no apology. Some of my articles are way off the mark; others fall short of the true damage Brexit has done to the country. But that's what happens when you try to forecast.

On the next page is my first subject, “Do I need it?”, where I questioned the true meaning of the word “need”.
