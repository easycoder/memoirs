# Chapel Allerton

At the time of writing (June 2021) this part of my story is unfinished. For three years we have been here as carers for Anna's Mum, living in Mum's house while waiting for our own one in Italy to be sold. This has just happened, with the inevitable consequence of hard decisions awaiting.

When we moved here, Anna was studying to become a funeral celebrant and was approaching local companies to be taken on as an independent celebrant. Business started to build during the latter half of 2019 and was going strongly at the time the Covid-19 pandemic struck in early 2020. Because of the limitations placed on the numbers allowed to attend funerals, interest was being shown in having services recorded or live-streamed. With our background making videos on the Riviera we were ideally placed to take on this work, and since mid 2020 it has boomed. There a page ~tid:Funerals:here~ that describes the work we do.
