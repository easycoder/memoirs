# Brentwood

From Penge Kay and I moved to Brentwood; possibly the worst housing purchase I ever made. The place was a semi-detached bungalow, shoddily built soon after the war. The walls were thin, the plaster weak and the fittings third-rate. The roof leaked at the slightest provocation and we didn't have the funds to do much about any of these things. I commuted to the Barbican, in London, to work in what was about to become British Telecom. The department I was in tested new telephone models, the Post Office still having a monopoly on the supply of these items, but the work was due to transfer to Research Department, based at Dollis Hill. I applied then transferred to that department as it seemed more dynamic and exciting.

Some time after moving in I sold the motorbike and bought a rather old Morris 1100 car. This lasted a few months then one morning, on my way to work, I misjudged a country bend and drove head first into a ditch. When the tow truck arrived they attached a rope to the back and dragged the car back up to the road, but it turned out the front and back were held together by little more than paint and rust, so the car was now somewhat longer on one side than the other. So I bought a kit to convert the remains to a Moke-style vehicle. The story of "Eyore" can be seen ~tid:Miscellany:here~.

And then one day Kay walked out. I'll never know the true story but it was quite obvious she had been living a secret life that I had no part in. To be fair, Eyore wasn't really her style and I think she'd given up any hope that I might one day become respectable. The divorce was messy and involved selling the house; no easy task as it was not the most desirable of properties. In the middle of all this I met Frances, who was to become my second wife.

The research department was planning to move out of London and over the next year or so it eventually settled on Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich. Frances had only recently herself been divorced and her family home was similarly under threat, so we made plans to move to East Anglia with her 2 daughters. Looking back, it's amazing that things worked out reasonably well; the house did eventually sell but was demolished soon after, having been judged to be unfit for habitation. This didn't surprise me but inevitably called into question the soundness of my original decision to buy the place.
