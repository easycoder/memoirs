# Semoigo

In the spring of 2012 I became half-owner of the house at Semoigo, while still working in Coventry. Anna's husband was still occupying the Semoigo house but living under the radar, unknown to the authorities who would soon be pursuing him for payment of the court judgement against him. Anna remained in Torri for that summer, then in September 2012 we were contacted by another past acquaintance, an old friend of Anna's from England who was also owed a considerable sum of money by Anna's husband. We arranged for the friend to visit us and stay nearby, and on September 14 we all went up to Semoigo. The house was barred and apparently empty but we knew full well Anna's husband was inside, so we loudly suggested we would be back the following day with the police, then left.

When we returned the following day there was no sign of occupancy, so we let ourselves in. The house was in a dreadful state of uncleanliness, looking as though occupied by a tramp, so we cleared all the personal belongings we could find into plastic sacks and left them outside. I remained at the house for a couple of hours while the others went out to buy padlocks and chains. While they were out, Anna's husband appeared. We had a brief confrontation then he picked up a couple of sacks and went off on foot. Over the next 6 months or so there were occasional unconfirmed sightings but since then he has vanished completely. It comes as no surprise that he did not choose to complain to the authorities about his treatment, since his record was always of one who was openly contemptuous of any such dealings and who frequently used false names to hide his identity.

For the next few months Anna remained at Torri but visited the Semoigo house regularly to clean and prepare for us to move back in. On most occasions she would ask friends to accompany her, for her own safety in case her husband were minded to seek revenge for being evicted.

On the sale of the Torri apartment in June 2013, Anna had nowhere to go but Semoigo. By then I had changed all the locks and installed a multiple-camera security system to record any movement outside the house. She then moved in and I went back to work in Coventry. The next few months were hard for her as there was always the fear that he might return with evil intent, so I decided to terminate work in Coventry at the end of the year, as much as for her safety as anything else. On December 20th 2013 I left Coventry and returned to Italy to begin the next stage of our life together.

Although our monthly ougtgoings were greatly reduced from what had previously been, we still had no regular source of income sufficient to meet our needs. There was a risk my Mum's inheritance would dribble away on daily living, so we hatched bold plan to improve the house. The original owner had constructed it as a 1-bedroom house because he didn't want anyone staying over. The house is on a steep hillside with 2 floors, the main entrance being on the upper floor. The living room, bedroom and bathroom were on that level and below was a kitchen and dining room that opened onto a large terrace. Our plan was to build an extension on the lower level, with a roof terrace accessed from the upper. The extension would comprise a master bedroom and en-suite bathroom, the existing kitchen would become a bedroom, the dining room would become a third bedroom and the upstairs bedroom would become the kitchen.

We engaged a local builder whose wife was the sister of some close friends in the next village, but this turned out to be a mistake. Work was of poor quality and proceeded very slowly, and it was quite evident that he wouldn't keep to the original quoted price, so we dismissed him and looked for another builder. This time we struck lucky with a locally-based Neapolitan artisan, who finished the work in record time and kept to his quoted price. We now had a house to be proud of.

However, funds were still an issue. Then one day in April 2016 I was contacted by the same person who had recruited me to work in Coventry, asking me if I was still interested in work. At the age of 68 this was both surprising and most welcome. The company was in Birmingham but most of the programmers worked remotely from home, including one in Romania and another in Spain, so it didn't really matter that I was in Italy. The pay was good and the hours flexible. We now had enough to hire a gardener to do the jobs I would otherwise be doing, and much more besides, so the garden started to be transformed and we were able to build up a modest fund again.

Then in January 2017 Anna went down with flu for a couple of weeks. I was initially unafffected but it then hit me in an unexpected way, causing a sudden partial loss of hearing.
