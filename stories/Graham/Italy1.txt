# Pian del Soglio

Pian del Soglio is a "frazione" - that is, a district - of Apricale, a small mountain village about 12 miles from the Mediterranean, close to the border with France. Apricale is well-known as a tourist destination and has been judged Italy's Most Beautiful Village on 2 occasions. The village has no roads that can bear normal traffic so it can only be reached on foot from the road that passes along its edge.

There's nothing in Pian del Soglio except houses dotted along a winding mountain road, about 2km from the village itself. The house we bought was in fact 2 houses, one on top of the other; what is known in Italian as a "bifamiliare", though we bought it as a single dwelling.

The house we bought in 2006 was beautiful and comfortable but some way off perfect. It was perched right on the edge of the land it occupied and the access was down a steep slope. It had problems with drainage, with some ingenuity needed to overcome bad smells, but it was a pleasant enough place to live. All through the first winter I toiled in the garden, separated from my computer by the lack of any broadband service. Then in the spring of 

Frances and I lasted a year there, during which time the strains of moving away from our home country began to tell. Frances made little effort to adjust to another country and no attempt to learn the language. She rejected friendship with anyone who wasn't 100% English, which limited us to only 1 or 2 people we could call friends. One such couple, Anna and David, who lived about a kilometer away, turned out to have a relationship that was strained even further than ours. David was a strange and rather unwholesome individual and I found myself drawn to Anna as one of the few people I could talk to about my fears regarding the direction life was taking me. Although we never at that point took it further than friendship it was probably the straw that broke the camel's back. Frances became ever more hostile to all things Italian. Then one day I blurted out that I had feelings for Anna and the dam broke. Within hours I had moved out and the path was set for us to split up, with her returning to England a few months later following the sale of the house and division of the proceeds. After a few days of utter chaos Anna and I found a flat to rent in the middle of Ventimiglia.
