# Cambridge

When we sold the Wymondham bungalow we rented another bungalow, this time at Rampton, a couple of miles from Histon, where I worked at De Novo Pharmaceuticals. The village lacked anything in the way of a proper community; village life centered on two churches, each with its own loyal group of parishoners endlessly warring with each other. The bungalow was spacious but rather bland and came with a huge garden we had no chance of ever taming. The intention was to stay there for as long it took us to decide on where to next buy a house, but events took over.

My Italian studies had continued even after the long commute was over; I'd completed a GCSE course in Cambridge and was getting quite comfortable with the language. My job at De Novo lasted for a year or so longer, then problems arose. The company was venture funded and its future was very uncertain so they laid off all but the core staff, which meant I would shortly be without a job again. With 18 months to go until retirement I wrote off my chances of finding another decent job.

After largely giving up skiing we'd had a couple of summer trips to Italy, and the idea had formed of buying a house there for retirement. I have to admit it was mainly my idea; it was hard to know what Frances really wanted as she would only say what she didn't want. I suspect that she wanted to go to a time rather than a place and was unable to come to terms with grandchildren growing up. On the last of our Italian holidays, in May 2006, we visited a number of properties for sale and one stood out. We both loved it immediately (whatever doubts Frances may have had she didn't express them then) and we decided to buy the house. On our return to England we put things in motion and in September relocated a thousand miles across Europe with our belongings.
